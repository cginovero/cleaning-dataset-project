## cleaning-dataset-project

**This project is one of the requirements for the  Getting and Cleaning Data Course.**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

the outcomes of this project are the following:

-  a tidy data set;
-  a link to a Github repository with script for performing the analysis; and
-  a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
